Front-end side
==============

Endpoint pages
--------------

Front-end side based on **HTML+CSS+JS**.

JS in iVIS powered by **jQuery** library.

To expand jQuery functionality was used several plugins:

    #. jQuery Validation Plugin;
    #. jQuery Tristate Plugin.

Server side pages
-----------------

Source code of endpoint pages placed in **JSPs**.

JSPs designed with **JSTL** and **Spring** tag libraries.

**Apache tiles** composed several JSP views with templates to one endpoint page.
